The BitVector class was packaged using Distutils.  For installation,
execute the following command-line in the source directory (this is
the directory that contains the setup.py file after you have
downloaded and uncompressed the tar archive):

    python setup.py install

You have to have root privileges for this to work.  On Linux
distributions, this will install the module file at a location that
looks like

     /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

If you do not have root access, you have the option of working
directly off the directory in which you downloaded the software by
simply placing the following statements at the top of your scripts
that use the BitVector class

    import sys
    sys.path.append( 'pathname_to_BitVector_directory' )

To uninstall the module, simply delete the source directory, locate
where BitVector was installed with "locate BitVector" and delete
those files.  As mentioned above, the full pathname to the installed
version is likely to look like
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/BitVector*

If you want to carry out a non-standard install of BitVector, look
up the on-line information on Disutils by pointing your browser to
